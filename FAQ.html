                <h3>Q: I have some stains in my carpet; can you remove all of them?</h3>
                <p>Some stains can be removed such as wax, wine, coffee/tea, gum, juice/Kool-Aid, ink, and pet accidents. Exactly which stains can be removed can be evaluated by the technician in person.</p>

                <h3>Q: Don't dry cleaning methods leave carpets dryer and cleaner? </h3>
                <p>As far as we all know all dry cleaning methods use water except one which does use a chemical that is put in saw dust, then sprinkled onto the carpet and brushed in, then vacuumed out. Carpet dries very fast but is still dirty by all standards and your carpet is now full of saw dust unless the carpet had no nap (such as an indoor /outdoor) and therefore is easy to vacuum the saw dust out. Now as far as the rest go, to clean a carpet with some water and then call it a dry cleaning method is dishonest unless you say that you are using a semi - dry cleaning. Meaning to say that you are using less water then a steam machine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tile-item">
                <h3>Q: Does not Steam Cleaning leave the carpet too wet?</h3>
                <!-- <p style="font-size: 18px; color: rgb(40, 203, 4);">Answer:</p> -->
                <p>That’s like saying “my stove gets to hot” or to say “my car drives to fast” or to say “I use too much salt”. Well I have a suggestion, turn the stove down, pick your right foot up a little, you must take control of your salt shaker. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that no steam machine in the world puts out hot steam unless you pull the trigger.</p>
                <p>Even the so called “dry bonnet cleaning method” puts these bonnets into a mop bucket “filled” with hot water. And the man who doesn’t wring the bonnet out enough will over wet the carpet much worse then a steam machine because he has no way to extract the water. He could try to absorb some water by using a dry bonnet but that area will be too wet. And it is not the method’s fault but the person who is using the method. The same is true with steam cleaning. Steaming can dry very fast under certain conditions but it is the trained person who will dry the carpet, not the method.</p>

                <h3>Q: While I heard a lot of good things about truck mount machines, I tried one but the experience was not great.</h3>
                <p>I know exactly what you are saying here. “Truck mount” is a term used to say that the machine is mounted in the truck. But the problem is, some companies make these machines very small and they are bolted down so therefore called a “truck mount”. The small truck mount may be stronger then a portable machine but when you put a long hose all the way to the rooms being cleaned then the loss of power will make it weaker then a portable.</p>
                <p>So point being here is make sure that the machine the company is using to clean your carpet is the big truck mount that uses a number 5 blower or bigger (no smaller). The rest is up to the operator. These machines have filters and we clean our filters out every job. We design our own filters to be accessible so the technicians can get at them easy and therefore are willing to clean them. Believe it or not some companies do not clean their filters for over a week. We clean ours every single job. And on a very soiled job we may clean it 2 or 3 times what ever it takes to keep the vacuum up to 15” of mercury and the air flow at over 500 cfm.</p>

                <h3>Q: Do not franchises do a better job cleaning?</h3>
                <p>This one will be easy, who makes a better Hamburger, your husband or wife on your grill or the big yellow arches? The truth is Franchises help in marketing and buying cleaners and image and how to make a lot of money. But they all clean to fast, way to fast. This I know by experience because I have worked for two of them.</p>
                <p>The way we clean here is 180 degrees different. We clean thoroughly and so much so that workers who were training with me have quit working for us because they were used to doing it much faster and were not willing to be that detailed. It really all depends on the manager of any company, if he or she really cares about quality or not.</p>
                <p>You must admit that we see all around us, that there are companies out there in all fields, that do not do quality work. As our slogan is: "We clean the corners that others cut"®.</p>
