            <!-- <h3>Our Story</h3> -->
            <p>In 1981 the construction job that I was working for had came to a close and therefore I started looking for another job. I took a job working for a Carpet Cleaning company called Stanley Steemer in Florida. During that time something happen that caused me to decide that I would some day make my own big machine and would start my own cleaning business. I knew that I would have to know how to weld so I went to a welding school at nights and worked during the days. I stayed there for about 4½ years until I got news that my Mother was dying with cancer. I moved to Michigan to be with my Mother during this time.</p>
            <p>In Michigan I took a job there working for a company called Sun-Glo Carpet Cleaners. As soon as I took this job I started my project of making my own Carpet Cleaning machine. This took me about 18 months of working on this project every night after work, and cost me over $13,000.00 to make it myself. The machine would run off the transmission of the van. It was then I moved to North West Indiana in 1986 with my new machine to start my very own business.</p>
            <p>I only had one problem, I had no customers. So I grabbed my welding hood and took a job welding trains together in Chicago Heights Ill. at a place called Thrall Car. I welded from 4:00 p.m. till they said we were done. Any where from 1:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. Then go home sleep a few and be at my first job at about 9:00 a.m. and work till 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. at the latest and you guessed it, grabbed that welding hood and trade hours for dollars. I did this until the phone was ringing enough to stop the welding job.</p>
            <p>Since then I have been through 8 different schools on cleaning, mostly cleaning delicate fabric. I now have been in over 23,000 homes myself and have cleaned some stuff that some cleaners have said that they would never touch. I still clean for people that I started cleaning for back in 1986 when I first came here. You will read about a few of these on the testimonial page. I also worked for one of the Sur- Pro companies but we won’t go there.</p>
